# CPU-Scheduling-Java
CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair.

Implementataion the following CPU scheduling algorithms in Java:

a.	FCFS

b.	Preemptive SJF

c.	Non-preemptive SJF

d.	Preemptive Priority (lower the integer, higher the priority)

e.	Non-Preemptive Priority (lower the integer, higher the priority)

f.	Round Robin

The input screen contains the no. of processes (<= 6), arrival time, burst time, priority, time quantum (for RR), checkboxes for algorithm selection and button for computation.

The output screen contains the Gantt chart, waiting time and turnaround time for each process, average waiting time, and average turnaround time.
